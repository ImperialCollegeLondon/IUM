# Introduction to University Mathematics

These are Lean files which relate to Imperial College London's Introduction to University Mathematics course. I lectured Part II in 2023-24, and the files contain self-contained definitions of the integers and the rationals from "the ground up". 

Note that everything from 2019 to 2022 is autoported and probably doesn't work. But stuff in the 2023 directory works.
