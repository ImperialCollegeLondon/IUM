# Introduction to University Mathematics

These are Lean files which relate to Imperial College London's Introduction to University Mathematics course. 

In 2022 I lectured Part I, and the files in the `2022` directory contain many basic examples and questions formalised in Lean.

I lectured Part II in 2023, and the files in the `2023` directory contain self-contained definitions of the integers and the rationals from "the ground up". 

Everything in `Old` is autoported from Lean 3 and may well not run without being fixed up.
