let's jump ahead a little and think about how we might make the positive _rational_ numbers like $`3/7`, because the same issues will show up here and I think they're a bit easier to understand.

Let's define the positive naturals $`\N_{>0}=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}` to be $`\N` with $`0` removed.
Now, every positive rational number $`q` can be expressed as a ratio $`a/b` of positive naturals, and in particular can be built from two positive naturals.
So how about we just _define_ the positive rationals to be $`\N_{>0} \times \N_{>0}`, the set of ordered pairs of positive naturals?
The ordered pair $`(3,7)` would then correspond to the rational number $`3/7`.

But there is a problem here: we have _too many_ positive rationals with this definition.
The ordered pairs $`(1,2)` and $`(2,4)` are different pairs
(they are different vectors in the plane, if you like),
but the rational numbers $`1/2` and $`2/4` are _equal_.
There isn't just _one_ way to write a positive rational $`q` as a ratio $`a/b`, there are _lots_ of ways.

What we want to do then, is to start with $`\N_{>0} \times \N_{>0}` (which is too big) and then "squish some elements together" and somehow make $`(1,2)` and $`(2,4)` "equal" even though they are not actually equal.
Once we have squished $`(1,2)` and $`(2,4)` and $`(3,6)` and $`(n,2n)` together, and then squished together all the other different pairs of positive naturals which give rise to the same rational,
then we really will have defined the positive rationals.

This squishing together of different elements of a set is formally done by putting an _equivalence relation_ on the set, and then considering the _equivalence classes_.
The axioms of an equivalence relation are an attempt to mimic and generalise the concept of equality.
When you quotient out a set by an equivalence relation by taking the set of equivalence classes, the concept of equivalence in the bigger set _becomes_ the concept of equality in the quotient set:
if $`x\sim y` are equivalent, then the equivalence classes $`cl(x)` and $`cl(y)` are _equal_.

Note that there is another possibility here:
instead of squishing different pairs together, we could decide to _reject_ a pair $`(a,b)` if it's not "in lowest terms",
i.e. if there is some prime number $`p` dividing both $`a` and $`b`.
This might superficially look simpler, but it causes real problems later on.
For example the standard formula $`\frac{a}{b}\times\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ac}{bd}` for multiplying fractions would no longer be valid if we took this approach,
because even if $`a/b` and $`c/d` are in lowest terms, $`ac/bd` might not be.
If you define the product to be "put $`\frac{ac}{bd}` in lowest terms" then proving things like associativity of multiplication becomes a _nightmare_.
Instead of having to manipulate $`ac/bd` to put it into lowest terms,
our approach is to allow non-lowest-terms fractions but set things up so that they are _equivalent_ to the corresponding lowest term fraction, and then use equivalence classes.

We'll come back to the rationals in the next chapter, but let's use the ideas above to make the integers.
Just like every positive rational can be written as the ratio of two natural numbers,
