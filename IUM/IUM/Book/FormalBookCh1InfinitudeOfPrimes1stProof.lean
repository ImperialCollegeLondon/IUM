# Six proofs of the inﬁnity of primes : Euclid's proof (first proof)

This file is part of a Master thesis project of formalizing some proofs from
"Proofs from THE BOOK" (5th ed.) by Martin Aigner and Günter M. Ziegler.

We refer to chapter 1: "Six proofs of the inﬁnity of primes".
In this file, we formalize "Euclid's proof", the first of the six proofs.

This proof is present in the form of `nat.exists_infinite_primes` in mathlib,
and is also taught in "Mathematics in Lean".

## Structure

- `Euclid_proof` :
      Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes,
      in the sense that for any finite set of natural numbers,
      we may find a prime not contained in it.

- `Euclid_proof_standardised` :
      Infinitude of primes in terms of `set.infinite`,
      proven with `Euclid_proof`.

/-- ### Euclids proof of the infinitude of primes

Assume for contradiction that we may put all primes
in a finite set `s`.

Take the sucessor of the product of all primes in `s`:
- this number must have a prime divisor
- this divisor must divide the product of primes
- the divisor must divide 1

We just found a prime that divides 1: a contradiction.

  -- Using the properties of divisibility, we reach a contradiction thorugh:
