# Six proofs of the inﬁnity of primes : 5th proof

This file is part of a Master thesis project of formalizing some proofs from
"Proofs from THE BOOK" (5th ed.) by Martin Aigner and Günter M. Ziegler.

We refer to chapter 1: "Six proofs of the inﬁnity of primes".
In this file, we formalize the "Fifth proof",
which makes use of Topology.


## Structure

- `fifth_proof` :
      We show that there are infinitely many primes,
      in the standardised sense for infinity.
- `bona_fide_topology` :
      Is the topology on ℤ we use throughout the proof.
      It's based on the sets `N`.
- `two_units_not_open` :
      Is the proof that the pathological set {-1,1} isn't open.
- `univ_sdiff_units_as_prime_union` :
      Is the proof that {-1,1}ᶜ is a union of closed sets,
      indexed by the primes.

/-- ### 5th proof of the infinitude of primes

We define a topology on ℤ based on two-way infinite arithmetic progressions.

- In this topology {-1,1} isn't open
- {-1,1}ᶜ is a union of closed sets, indexed by the primes

Hence, if there were finitely many primes, {-1,1}ᶜ would be closed,
contradicting the fact that {-1,1} isn't open.
