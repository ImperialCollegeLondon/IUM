# Six proofs of the inﬁnity of primes : 2nd proof

This file is part of a Master thesis project of formalizing some proofs from
"Proofs from THE BOOK" (5th ed.) by Martin Aigner and Günter M. Ziegler.

We refer to chapter 1: "Six proofs of the inﬁnity of primes".
In this file, we formalize the "Second proof",
which makes use of Fermat numbers.

This proof is based on the formalization of Moritz Firsching,
who's orginial work can be found on the repository at:
https://github.com/eric-wieser/formal_book

We've made some modifications and additions.

## Structure

- `second_proof`:
      The conclusion of our work. We show that we can form
      a (infinite) sequence of primes all pairwise different.
- `second_proof_standardised` :
      Infinitude of primes in terms of `set.infinite`,
      proven with `second_proof`.
- `F` :
      denotes  the Fermat number sequence.
- `fermat_product` :
      the recurrence relation satisfied by the Fermat numbers.
- `fermat_coprimes` :
      We show that the Fermat numbers are pairwise coprime.
      This is the the key step in showing infinitude of primes,
      as these numbers must have prime divisors, which must be
      pairwise different due to dividing coprime numbers.

/-- ### 2nd proof of the infinitude of primes

Consider a sequence of prime divisors of the *Fermat numbers*,
one divisor per Fermat number.

These primes must be different: if the dividors were equal,
they would divide the coprime Fermat numbers, and yet, be prime,
which is impossible.
